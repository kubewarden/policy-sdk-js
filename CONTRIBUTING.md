# Contributing

## Making a new release
1. Bump version in `js/package.json` to `"X.Y.Z"`.
2. Format if needed, commit and open PR (as `main` branch is protected).
3. Wait for PR to be merged.
4. Once the PR is in `main`, create an annotated signed tag on the merge commit
  of the PR in `main`:
  `git tag -s -a -m "vX.Y.Z" vX.Y.Z`. This will trigger the GH Action for
  release. Wait for it to complete and check that it is created.
5. If needed, edit the GH release description.

## Publishing to npm
When a tag is pushed, the following happens automatically:
- **CI tests** run to ensure code quality
- **E2E tests** validate functionality
- **npm package** is built and published to the registry with provenance
- **GitHub release** is published from the draft

## GitHub Actions
For some workflows, `NPM_TOKEN` needs read and write permissions (e.g: for npm
provenance and publishing); if you have forked the repository, you may need to
change "settings -> actions -> general -> workflow permissions" to "Read and
write permissions".

Also, given how the release and release-drafter workflows work, they need git
tags present; push the tags from origin to your fork.

## Code conventions
Code formatting is handled by Prettier. Run `npm run format` in the `js/`
directory before committing changes.
